## The Cleaning Script

The script below reads in the csv's needed and, at the end, outputs a merged CSV file containing the card and 2019 prices data joined by applicable columns. The inline comments explain what the script is doing at each stage. This data will later be compared with the 2020 price data, which is fundamentally a very different data set, though it has some variables that can be directly compared. This will be expanded on during the analysis.

### Post-Download Formatting
Because certain facets of the data cannot be retained when the data is formatted as a .CSV, we produced a 'post-download formatting' block which can be copied and pasted in at the beginning of any R file using the above CSV to convert the data to the ideal format for manipulation. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# TOKENIZING SUBTYPES
mtg$subtypes <- str_split(mtg$subtypes, ",")

# TOKENIZING KEYWORDS
mtg$keywords <- str_split(mtg$keywords, ",")

# TURNING RARITY INTO A FACTOR 
mtg$rarity <- factor(mtg$rarity, levels = c("common", "uncommon", "rare", "mythic"), ordered = TRUE)

#FORMATTING POWER AND TOUGHNESS CORRECTLY
  # forces some to numeric, however upon investigation the cards turned to NA's are 'booster' cards, which are like spell cards
  # these cards can be identified by their key words
mtg$power <- as.numeric(mtg$power)
mtg$toughness <- as.numeric(mtg$toughness)

```

```{r}

head(mtg, 20) %>%
  kalbleFormat("Clean Magic the Gathering Data")

```
